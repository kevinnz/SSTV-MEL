# Test Audio Files

Short SSTV audio recordings used during early development and debugging. These are ad-hoc test files for quick manual validation — not part of the automated test suite.

For the primary test samples used by `swift test`, see the [`samples/`](../samples/) directory.

## File Format

WAV format, mono, 16-bit PCM. Tracked with [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/).
